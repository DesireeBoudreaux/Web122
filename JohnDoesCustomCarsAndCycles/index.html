                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>John Doe's Custom Cars and Cycles began as a big dream in a little boy’s heart. John Doe spent countless
                    afternoons in the garage with his grandfather, learning how to rebuild old classic cars one bolt at
                    a time. Those early lessons weren’t just about engines; they were about patience, pride, and the joy
                    of creating something with your own hands. What started as simple tinkering grew into a lifelong
                    passion that eventually became the full‑service custom shop we run today. Every build we take on
                    still carries that same spirit: craftsmanship rooted in family, tradition, and the belief that every
                    ride deserves a story worth telling.</p>
                <p>From frame‑off restorations to subtle performance upgrades, we balance old‑school mechanical know‑how
                    with modern tools and diagnostics. We listen first to how you drive, where you drive, and what you
                    want your ride to say about you, then we design a build that fits your life.</p>

                <h3>What we do</h3>
                <p>The values learned in John Doe's grandfather’s garage still guide our work today. Whether we’re restoring
                    a classic, tuning a modern muscle car, or shaping a custom motorcycle, we approach every project with
                    the same care and curiosity that sparked this dream decades ago. We don’t rush builds or cut
                    corners. We build machines that are meant to last, meant to be driven, meant to thrill, and meant to
                    be remembered.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Restorations:</strong> Rust repair, bodywork, interior refresh, and period‑correct

                    <li><strong>Detail and Finishing:</strong> Paint correction, ceramic coatings, and show‑prep

                        riding style.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every project is treated like the ones that started it all — hands‑on, intentional, and built with
                    pride.</p>

                <p>These builds represent more than mechanical work — they are the continuation of a legacy that began
                    in a small garage with a grandfather passing down his knowledge. Each project carries that same
                    dedication to detail, respect for the craft, and love for the road.</p>
