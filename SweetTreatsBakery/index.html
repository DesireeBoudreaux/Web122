                <h2>About Sweet Treats Bakery</h2>
                <p>Sweet Treats Bakery began as a small spark of creativity in Jane Doe’s home kitchen, where she
                    discovered the joy of transforming simple ingredients into magical, joy‑filled desserts. What
                    started as weekend cravings and baking experiments quickly blossomed into a beloved local favorite
                    known for its whimsical flavors, handcrafted treats, and warm, welcoming atmosphere. Every dessert
                    is made with
                    intention, care, and a sprinkle of imagination — because we believe sweetness should feel personal,
                    comforting, and unforgettable.</p>
